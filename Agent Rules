# Agent Rules

1. Always show progress bar in terminal while installing dependencies.
   - Use `pip install -r requirements.txt --progress-bar on` for installations

2. Always update the README file with new relevant information, so that our unified prompt to create this application is always updated with latest information.

3. Read the "Agent Rules" file with every prompt input and add to prompt.

4. Maintain consistent code style across the project.
   - Follow PEP 8 standards for Python code
   - Use descriptive variable and function names
   - Add appropriate docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules

5. Prioritize error handling and logging.
   - Use try/except blocks for operations that might fail
   - Log errors and important events using the existing logger utility
   - Provide meaningful error messages to the user

6. Implement changes incrementally and test after each significant change.
   - Update or create tests for new functionality
   - Run existing tests to ensure no regressions

7. Document API changes in both code comments and README.
   - Include examples of usage when adding new features
   - Note any breaking changes prominently

8. Optimize for accessibility and user experience.
   - Ensure UI elements have appropriate labels for screen readers
   - Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Make sure error messages are clear and actionable

   9. Always propose changes with an apply button, never require copy-paste.
   - Provide an apply button for all code changes
   - Make sure changes can be applied with a single click
   - Never ask users to manually copy-paste code
   - Include clear descriptions of what each change will do
